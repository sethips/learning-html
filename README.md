# Getting Started with HTML

Have you ever wondered how to build a basic website? HTML is where you start.

## Motivation

The idea for this project came to me when one of my daughters and another daughter's boyfriend wanted to learn some basic development while in High School. Then my brother also expressed interest in learning to write code. I thought it was an awesome idea to start teaching them some basics, but our schedules were hectic. So I decided to centrallize the documentation here on GitHub for them. And now anyone else can share in the knowledge.

## What You'll Need

One of the great things about learning basic web development is that you don't need anything fancy to get started.

1. Text Editor (Atom, Sublime, VSCode)
1. Browser (Chrome preferred)

__Text Editor__ - A text editor is a stand alone application for writing the code for your projects. You will need to download whichever text editor you choose to your computer and configure it. I have used all three text editors listed above, and would strongly urge you to use VSCode simply because of its incredible IntelliSense. IntelliSense is a set of features that help you to learn more about the code that you are writing.

__Browser__ - Hopefully you already know what a browser is. Viewing what you have created in HTML is as simple as opening the HTML file in a browser. Can you believe it's that simple?!! Honestly, it doesn't matter which browser you use, but as you develop more advanced skills in writing HTML and CSS, a good set of debugging tools will make a huge difference. So I recommend that you start getting comfortable with the Chrome web browser.

## Getting Started

### What is HTML?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the basic building block that makes up the world wide web. HTML defines the structure and content of each webpage.

"HyperText" refers to the links (or hyperlinks) that connect webpages together. Without hyperlinks, every website would be made up of just one page, and no websites would be connected to each other. They are what create the "web" in World Wide Web.

Markup refers to the special elements that HTML uses to make up different parts of the webpage. The markup helps us to structure webpages in a consistent and readable manner.
