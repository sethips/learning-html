# Getting Started with HTML

Have you ever wondered how to build a basic website? HTML is where you start.

## What You'll Need

One of the great things about learning basic web development is that you don't need anything fancy to get started.

1. Text Editor (Atom, Sublime, VSCode)
1. Browser (Chrome preferred)

__Text Editor__ - A text editor is a stand alone application for writing the code for your projects. You will need to download whichever text editor you choose to your computer and configure it. I have used all three text editors listed above, and would strongly urge you to use VSCode simply because of its incredible IntelliSense. IntelliSense is a set of features that help you to learn more about the code that you are writing.

__Browser__ - Hopefully you already know what a browser is. Viewing what you have created in HTML is as simple as opening the HTML file in a browser. Can you believe it's that simple?!! Honestly, it doesn't matter which browser you use, but as you develop more advanced skills in writing HTML and CSS, a good set of debugging tools will make a huge difference. So I recommend that you start getting comfortable with the Chrome web browser.
